"""Codex review of the x2 candidates of one Flow submit against the job, the reference sheets and the previous/next shots (universal Flow image system, 2026-11-01).

  python scripts/flow/review_shot.py --jobs canon/drafts/A1_flow_jobs_v2.json --shot SH_S2_09 --candidate <A> [<B>]

A candidate may be a browser screenshot of the Flow tile (no download is needed to review) or a filed 2K image.
ONE Codex call per submit (owner 2026-11-01: least tokens, no shortcut): the continuity sheet PREVIOUS | A | B | NEXT + reference sheets,
plus each candidate at full size. Codex: model gpt-6.1-sol, reasoning effort medium, READ-ONLY. Every question is answered for every candidate.
Writes <A>__review.json (+ the sheet and the raw report). Fails closed per candidate: any BLOCK -> BLOCK; a missing answer, a missing verdict
or a verdict contradicting the answers -> UNSURE. CHOICE: only a PASS can be kept. Exit 0 PASS (keep), 1 BLOCK (fix), 3 UNSURE (stop, report), 2 refused."""

Image 1 is a continuity sheet, top row: {shown}; bottom row: the reference sheets (characters, then the place, then story props: compare props with their sheet exactly).
IGNORE the small Flow sparkle watermark at the lower right of every picture (accepted by the owner); it is never a defect or an advisory. Then {full}: judge faces, clothes, hands and small details there.

Every candidate was made from this prompt (the contract):
<<<{job['prompt']}>>>

For EACH candidate ({', '.join(labels)}) answer every question with exactly one line `<candidate> Q<n>: PASS|BLOCK|ADVISORY|UNSURE - <short reason>` (for example `A Q1: PASS - one person, open vest`).
BLOCK = a wrong, extra or missing person, wrong clothes/age/face against the sheet, wrong action or facing, place jump, a needed prop missing, wrong framing, text/inset/border, wrong style, or a cut that does not match the neighbours. ADVISORY = a harmless detail the prompt does not fix. UNSURE = you cannot see it well enough.
{qs}

Then for EACH candidate exactly these lines:
<candidate> FIX: none | edit | regenerate      (edit = one local defect in a good composition; regenerate = wrong person/identity/age/framing/pose)
<candidate> EDIT_INSTRUCTION: Change only <the defect>. Keep everything else exactly the same: <people, pose, place, props, style>.   (or: none)
<candidate> REGEN_SENTENCE: <one sentence to add to the prompt that fixes it>   (or: none)
<candidate> VERDICT: PASS | BLOCK | UNSURE
