## Verdict: FIX FIRST

### story_map

1. **High —** [story_map.py:81](</D:/aai work/granthstudio/scripts/pipeline/stage1/story_map.py:81>): `ovi_types: [null]` raises `AttributeError`. Check item types before reading them and return errors for malformed entries.
2. **Low —** [test_stage1_story_map.py:153](</D:/aai work/granthstudio/tests/test_stage1_story_map.py:153>): The tests require `lo > hi`, `key_ovi`, and `outside`, which the spec does not quote. Assert the event ID instead.

### coverage

1. **High —** [coverage.py:88](</D:/aai work/granthstudio/scripts/pipeline/stage1/coverage.py:88>): `ovis: [null]` raises `AttributeError`. Check entry types and return errors.

### scenes

1. **High —** [scenes.py:54](</D:/aai work/granthstudio/scripts/pipeline/stage1/scenes.py:54>): The schema rejects `teaching_treatment: "none"` for a story scene, although the spec permits it. Allow the field when its value is `"none"` and add a positive test.
2. **High —** [scenes.py:138](</D:/aai work/granthstudio/scripts/pipeline/stage1/scenes.py:138>): A range such as `["a", 2]` with turn ovi `1` raises `TypeError`. Validate both endpoints before comparing them with the turn.
3. **Low —** [test_stage1_scenes.py:188](</D:/aai work/granthstudio/tests/test_stage1_scenes.py:188>): The forbidden story treatment has no isolated schema test. Test that non-`"none"` treatment is rejected by `schema_errors`.

### shots

1. **High —** [shots.py:166](</D:/aai work/granthstudio/scripts/pipeline/stage1/shots.py:166>): `shots: [null]` raises `AttributeError` during the scene coverage check. Filter or type-check entries consistently throughout validation.
2. **High —** [shots.py:48](</D:/aai work/granthstudio/scripts/pipeline/stage1/shots.py:48>): The schema accepts any string as a preset, including `"bogus"`. Restrict it to the specified preset ID pattern or `"NEED_NEW"`.
3. **Low —** [test_stage1_shots.py:169](</D:/aai work/granthstudio/tests/test_stage1_shots.py:169>): The invalid `class` case fails because an object is forbidden for the existing preset, even if the class enum is removed. Set `preset` to `"NEED_NEW"` before testing the enum.

### briefs

1. **High —** [briefs.py:139](</D:/aai work/granthstudio/scripts/pipeline/stage1/briefs.py:139>): A nonempty list as `image_id` raises `TypeError` during set membership. Check the ID type before using it as a set key.
2. **High —** [briefs.py:63](</D:/aai work/granthstudio/scripts/pipeline/stage1/briefs.py:63>): `prop` and `prop_state` accept empty strings, but the spec defines text as 1–400 characters. Add `minLength: 1` and isolated tests.
3. **Low —** [test_stage1_briefs.py:263](</D:/aai work/granthstudio/tests/test_stage1_briefs.py:263>): Semantic tests assert phrases such as `unique with scene prefix` that the spec does not quote. Assert the item ID for these rules.

### looks

None.

### voices

1. **High —** [voices.py:66](</D:/aai work/granthstudio/scripts/pipeline/stage1/voices.py:66>): `cast: [1]` raises `AttributeError`. Check entry types and return errors.
2. **High —** [voices.py:76](</D:/aai work/granthstudio/scripts/pipeline/stage1/voices.py:76>): Two `NEW_PROPOSED` entries for a speaking character do not trigger the exactly-one-entry rule. A recurring character outside `speaking_characters` is also not checked for duplicates. Check counts independently of status and check recurring duplicates across the entire cast.
3. **High —** [voices.py:109](</D:/aai work/granthstudio/scripts/pipeline/stage1/voices.py:109>): If narrator and two other characters share a key, the narrator suppresses the error for the other pair. Check sharing between distinct non-narrator characters.
4. **Low —** [test_stage1_voices.py:180](</D:/aai work/granthstudio/tests/test_stage1_voices.py:180>): Tests assert unquoted wording such as `recurring character listed twice`. Assert the character ID and add isolated cases for the duplicate and sharing rules above.

### sounds

1. **High —** [sounds.py:98](</D:/aai work/granthstudio/scripts/pipeline/stage1/sounds.py:98>): A cue with a valid scene but missing `sound_id` raises `AttributeError`. Check that the ID is a string before calling `startswith`.
2. **Low —** [test_stage1_sounds.py:178](</D:/aai work/granthstudio/tests/test_stage1_sounds.py:178>): Tests assert unquoted wording such as `scene exists`. Assert the cue ID for rules without quoted messages.

### questions

1. **High —** [questions.py:60](</D:/aai work/granthstudio/scripts/pipeline/stage1/questions.py:60>): The odd-document fix is incomplete: `questions: [{"id": []}]` raises `TypeError` during set membership. Type-check IDs and scene IDs before set operations; add regression cases.

The semantic crash cases were reproduced with the available Python interpreter and a stub for `jsonschema`. I could not rerun the project tests: the sandbox denied launching the virtual-environment interpreter. I did not independently verify the reported green test run.
